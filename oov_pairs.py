"""OOV probe pairs: (sentence_a, sentence_b, label, group).

Out-of-vocabulary is relative to build_vocab(TRAIN_PAIRS).
Kept separate from pairs.py on purpose: this is a probe, not part of the main
evaluation, so the TEST_PAIRS results stay comparable across runs.

POS-k / NEG-k: the same pair with progressively more words swapped for unseen
synonyms (k = 0 is the in-vocab original). This isolates the effect of OOV
words from the effect of the cause itself.
FULL-*: every word in both sentences is out of vocabulary.
